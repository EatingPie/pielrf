Program: pielrf

Support: striphtml and asciicheck

Author: EatingPie <pie@storybytes.com>
        Special Thanks to Lee Bigelow for Unicode and .pielrfrf support

    Creates a Sony Reader/Librie lrf file from a text file.
    Includes easy table of contents, chapterization and curly quotes.


    *striphtml* removes any HTML tags that pielrf does not understand.
    It's exactly the same as providing the "--strip-html" flag to
    pielrf, but creating a seperate stripped file makes it a little
    easier to add <chapter> tags if there's a lot of funky HTML in
    the original.

    *striphtml* was mainly designed for use with ConvertLit output HTML.

    *asciicheck* scans your file and reports any characters that are
    not strict ascii.  While pielrf supports unicode, some ascii files
    have invalid characters in them, causing pielrf to THINK they're
    unicode.  If you know you have an ascii file, and pielrf thinks
    it's unicode, you can run asciicheck to find the bad characters.
    
INSTALLATION

	(1) Make sure you've got Python 2.5
		% python --version
		Python 2.5

	(2) Install Python 2.5 if necessary

		<http://www.python.org/download>

	(3) Install pielrf and packages (from the pielrf directory)

	    % python setup.py install

		This automatically installs (or gives instructions)
		the pylrs-1.0.0 and ElementTree packages, as well as
		pielrf.

QUICKSTART

    pielrf -i infile.txt -o outfile.lrf -t "Book Title" -a "Author Name"

    This will generate a basic LRF file, with a single "Table of Contents"
    entry, flowed paragraphs, curly-quotes and page headers.  Sweet!

QUICKSTART II

    If you want a Table of Contents and Chapters, it takes just ONE WORD(!!)
    in your book's text file!

        <chapter>

    If your book is like this...

        Chapter One
            Some Text
            ...
        Chapter Two
            Some More Text

    Just do this...

        <chapter>Chapter One
            Some Text
            ...
        <chapter>Chapter Two
            Some More Text

    Both chapters are added to the Reader's Table of Contents, as well
    as a "Table of Contents" page.  "Chapter One" and "Chapter Two"
    are also made headers for their respective chapters.  Very nice!

HTML FOR TYPOGRAPHY

    You can control typography for such things as Bold and Italics by
    using standard HTML tags in your text.

    Recognized Tags

		NON-HTML (pielrf specific)

		<JUSTIFIED></JUSTIFIED>   - JUSTIFIED TEXT - NO FIRST LINE INDENT
		<VERSE></VERSE>           - POETIC VERSE, REVERSE INDENT

		HTML

        <CENTER></CENTER>         - CENTERED TEXT
        <BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE> - LEFT/RIGHT INDENTED BLOCK OF TEXT
        <I></I>                   - ITALICS
        <B></B>                   - BOLD
        <SUB></SUB>               - SUBSCRIPT
        <SUP></SUP>               - SUPERSCRIPT
        <BR>                      - LINE BREAK (Vertical Whitespace)
        <H1></H1>
        <H2></H2>
        <H3></H3>                 - Heading (bold+large font), strength 1-3

    These are the only HTML tags recognized (beside <P></P> for
    paragraphs).

    pielrf also supports 100% of the HTML Ampersand flags for special
    typographic symbols (the ISO Latin set).  A few examples (of
    the 200 or so!):

        &pound;        - The English Pound Symbol.
        &mdash;        - An Em-Dash.
        &iexcl;        - Inverted exclamation mark.
        &copy;         - the copyright symbol.
        etc.
        etc.
        etc.
        etc. (No, really, there's a lot of these things!)

FEATURES

	* Top-of-Page Headers, similar to books dowloaded from Sony's Connect Store
    * Table of Contents and Chapterization if you use the <chapter> tag.
    * Curly (typographic) quotes.
    * Paragraph auto-flow.
    * Double or triple dashes are converted to em-dashes
    * Understands HTML tags <i></i>, <b></b> <center></center>,
      <sub></sub>, <sup></sup>, <p></p>.
    * Understands ALL HTML Ampersand tags - &amp;, &pound, &uumlat, etc.
    * Paragraphs can be delimited by tabs, spaces, vertical whitespace.
    * Font size / weight (bold) can be controlled from command line.
    * Heck, you can control ALL the options from the command line too!
	* You can SAVE all your options by specifying the --write-rc switch

OPTION OVERLOAD

    You can control just about every option regarding layout.  But don't
    get overwhelmed.  The defaults should work just fine.  All you need to
    provide are the input and output files, and a title and author.  To
    see the options just type:

        pielrf -h

ISSUES

    (1) Indentation must be consistent.  If you paragarph-indent
        using a tab, all paragraphs must use a tab or they will
        be lumped together with the previous paragraph.

    (2) Vertical Whitespace REQUIRES a <BR> tag.  This isn't really a
        bug.

THANKS

	Thanks to Lee Bigelow for his contribution to unicode support,
	as well as .pielrfrc functionality.

    Thanks to Fallstaff for pylrs-1.0.0, and the makers of the
	ElementTree library.  Without their work, pielrf would not have
	been possible.
