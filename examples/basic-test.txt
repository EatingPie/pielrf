<chapter>Preface

	In this example, I only use the &lt;chapter&gt; tag, and each paragraph begins with a tab.  That's it.
	This is to illustrate how easy it is to use the program.
	Um... except... this example was so short, I had to force paragraph break-on-tabs with the "-b tab" option. (The auto detect alogrithm chooses carriage-returns because it sees more of those than tabs.)
	"pielrf -i basic-test.txt -o basic-test.lrf -b tab"

<chapter> Book One

	I really didn't want to learn Python.  I figured C, C++, Fortran, Perl, LISP, BASIC -- yes, BASIC -- Prolog, SIMSCRIPT, Simula, Lex, YACC, bash, csh, sh, and whatever else I've forgotten, was enough!
	I mean, "enough is enough" as they say.

<chapter>Book Two

	Well, crud, 'makelrf3' didn't do what I wanted, and I sure as heck wasn't going to implement everything in C.  So back to square one... aka... Python!

<chapter>Book Three

	This book is already too long.  Let's just say I learned Python in a couple of days, and wrote a program to do everything I wanted...
	The End
